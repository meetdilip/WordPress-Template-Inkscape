# WordPress-Template-Inkscape
Helps you create WordPress ready images with ease

Planning to use Inkscape to create an image for your WordPress blog? Not sure about the image size, or confused how to set them in Inkscape? Ready to use WordPress image templates for Inkscape. 

For Ubuntu users, add them to 

/.config/inkscape/templates

Don't blame me if your theme has different requirments or the image size gets changed overnight. Happy to make modifications if you can suggest with valid data.
